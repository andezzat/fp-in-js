# Functional Programming in JavaScript
## Mocking is a Code Smell :poop:
---

<Invert>

## Disclaimer

<Appear>

#### Mocking is :ok: for integration tests!
#### FP is best used w/ OOP & co.

</Appear>

</Invert>

## Agenda

<Appear>

#### :white_check_mark: Testing & coverage
#### :syringe: Mocking w/ dependency injection
#### :thinking_face: An alternative solution
#### :sparkles: Intro to Functional Programming

<Invert>

#### But first...
## What EXACTLY is a code smell :poop: ?

</Invert>

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### What EXACTLY is a code smell :poop: ?

#### “A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.”

##### - Martin Fowler

</LayoutContextTitle>

</Invert>

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### What EXACTLY is a code smell :poop: ?

## Some examples

<Appear>

#### Big functions :arrow_up_down:
#### Repitition/Duplication :repeat:
#### Early Performance Optimization :zap:
#### Comments (sweetest) :speech_balloon:

## Testing & Coverage
# :white_check_mark:
---

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### Testing & Coverage :white_check_mark:

## Types of Tests

<Appear>

#### Unit :one:
#### Integration :fast_forward:
#### Functional / E2E :black_right_pointing_double_triangle_with_vertical_bar:

</Appear>

</LayoutContextTitle>

<Notes>

Unit: building blocks, black-box testing, test in isolation; test most

Integration: testing multiple layers or units together; test less

Functional: testing all layers, like a user would; test less

</Notes>

---

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### Testing & Coverage :white_check_mark:

## Types of Coverage

<Appear>

#### Code Coverage
#### Case Coverage

</Appear>

</LayoutContextTitle>

<Notes>

code: how much of the code is tested
case: how much of the real-world use cases are tested

</Notes>

---

<Invert>

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### Testing & Coverage :white_check_mark:

### 100% Code Coverage != 100% Case Coverage!

</LayoutContextTitle>

</Invert>

<Notes>

That means:

We need a healthy number of different types of tests.

Lots of unit testing, some integration, some e2e.

## Mocking w/ Dependency Injection
# :syringe:

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### Mocking w/ Dependency Injection :syringe:

## What is a Mock?

#### Any code that stands in as a "test double" for another

</LayoutContextTitle>

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### Mocking w/ Dependency Injection :syringe:

## An Example

</LayoutContextTitle>

---

##### Mocking w/ Dependency Injection :syringe:

```js
// identityService.js
import userProvider from '../userProvider'
import orgProvider from '../orgProvider'

const createIdentityService = () => ({
  getUser: async id => {
    const user = await userProvider.getById({ id })
    if (!formattedUser.id || !formattedUser.name) throw new Error('Invalid User!')

    const org = await orgProvider.getById(user)
    const formattedUser = { ...user, org }

    return formattedUser
  }
})
```

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### Mocking w/ Dependency Injection :syringe:
### Looks Good!

<Appear>

#### But this function has logic we need to test
#### So... let's unit test it!

</Appear>

</LayoutContextTitle>

<Invert>

<LayoutContextTitle>

##### Mocking w/ Dependency Injection :syringe:

### Hold on
##### This logic can't be tested in isolation w/o mocking the dependencies!
# :scream:

##### Mocking w/ Dependency Injection :syringe:

### And then it goes something like..

#### Test w/ Them :white_check_mark:

</Appear>

</LayoutContextTitle>

##### Mocking w/ Dependency Injection :syringe:

```js
// identityService.js
const createIdentityService = ({ userProvider, orgProvider }) => ({
  getUser: async id => ...,
})
```

##### Mocking w/ Dependency Injection :syringe:

```js
// identityService.test.js
import createIdentityService from './identityService'

const user = { id: 1, name: 'Andrew' }
const org = { id: 101, name: 'MelbJS' }

const invalidUserProvider = { getById: () => ({}) }
const userProvider = { getById: () => user }
const orgProvider = { getById: () => org }

describe('identityService.getUser()', () => {
  it('throws if user is invalid', () =>
    expect(
      createIdentityService({ userProvider: invalidUserProvider })
        .getUser({ id: 1 })
    ).to.throw(
      new Error('Invalid User!')
    )
  )
  it('returns correctly formatted user {}', () =>

#### What if our integration was dead simple?

##### An Alternative Solution :thinking_face:

```js

  isValid: user => !user.id || !user.name,
}

// identityService.js
import userProvider from '../userProvider'
import orgProvider from '../orgProvider'
import identityHelper from './identityHelper'

const getUserWithOrg = async user => ({ user, org: await orgProvider.getById(user) })
const throwIfUserInvalid = user => identityHelper.isValid(user)
  ? Promise.resolve(user)
  : Promise.reject('Invalid User!')

const createIdentityService = () => ({
  getUser: id => userProvider.getById(id)
    .then(getUserWithOrg)
    .then(identityHelper.format)
    .then(throwIfUserInvalid),
})

##### An Alternative Solution :thinking_face:

## What Have We Done?

<Appear>

#### Our integration is now a promise chain
#### There is nothing to test here
#### Just unit test the logic/branching

<Notes>

Promises have their own tests.

We can unit test our other functions within their units in isolation.
